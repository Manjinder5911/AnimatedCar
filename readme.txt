It is a simple animated car which is displayed as moving on road.

First of all, the wheels of car are separated from body to separately show their motion using transform and animation.

There will be motion of 3 different things to show apparently that car is moving.
1. Track - the road moves backward in negative x-direction .
2. Car - the car is moved few pixels in y-direction and returned back to make movement more realistic.
3. Wheels = it is an important part of this project to move wheels as the car moves.
